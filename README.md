# Website: Memory Game

## Project Information

### About

This project was developed for my Front-End Developer Nanodegree from Udacity. In this project, we were tasked to create a classic card-flipping memory game. The game utilized query selectors and DOM manipulation through JavaScript to construct the logic behind the game: keeping track of matched pairs, number of moves made, a star rating, and a timer.

### Concepts

Include information about the concepts, technologies, packages, and frameworks used to develop the project

- JavaScript was used to program the logic behind the game
- Media queries were used to make the game responsiveness across a range of screen sizes
- Query methods and DOM manipulation were used to implement the interactivity of the application
